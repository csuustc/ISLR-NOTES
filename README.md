# ISLR-NOTES

This repository contains the learning notes when I go through the book [**An Introduction to Statistical Learning**](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013), which is a very helpful book for kicking off machine learning.

These notes not only include the key points in this book and corresponding slides, but also provide some mathematical equations and proofs from another book, [**The Elements of Statistical Learning**](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), which provide more technical details.

Hope this repository can help you start your learning path.
